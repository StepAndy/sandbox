Todays Doodle celebrates Sarah Fanny Durack, a titan in her sport who fought tirelessly for the right to represent her country on the world stage. In 1912 Fanny became the first Australian woman to win an Olympic gold medal in swimming, going on to break every world record in womens swimming from the 100-meter to the 1-mile.
